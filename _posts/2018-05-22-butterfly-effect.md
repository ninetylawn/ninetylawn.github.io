We often quote the butterfly effect when some seemingly small, insignificant thing has an _unpredictable_, yet large effect on the outcome. A butterfly flapping its wings here and causing a typhoon half way around the world is the example often used. However, in Greg Egan's sci-fi novel [Permutation City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City), technology and science in the future are so advanced that people are able to use the butterfly effect to their advantage -- particularly, for weather control. By making minimal changes to a interdependent, seemingly chaotic system they can exact large beneficial outcomes disproportionate to their effort.

I think there's a pretty important lesson here. There are a lot of things that affect our lives, and a lot of things in our lives that are each deeply intertwined: traffic grids, complex machines, biological systems, our mind, body & wellbeing, and our relationships to other people. None of us want to work harder than we have to to get what makes us happy; in a perfect world, we'd always want minimal effort to result in disproportionately beneficial effects.
