There are a lot of things that affect our lives, and a lot of things in our lives that are each deeply intertwined and complex: traffic grids, machines, biological systems, our mind, body & wellbeing, and our relationships with other people. How do we navigate these systems to get the most out of them?

The answer might lie in the butterfly effect. 

We often quote the butterfly effect when some seemingly small, insignificant thing has an _unpredictable_, yet large effect on the outcome; a butterfly flapping its wings here and causing a typhoon half way around the world is the example often used. However, in Greg Egan's sci-fi novel [Permutation City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City), technology and science in the future are so advanced that people are able to use the butterfly effect to their advantage -- particularly, for weather control. By making minimal changes to the atmosphere -- an interdependent, seemingly chaotic system -- they can exact large beneficial weather outcomes disproportionate to their effort.

... large beneficial outomes, disproportionate to effort. Sounds awesome.

They key for harnessing the butterfly effect is first to understand that in many interdependent systems\*, changing a particular component has a non-linear, amplifying effect on the outcome. Non-linear, amplifying effects are often difficult to predict, and most often they negative in nature. After all, messing with the most interconnected cog in a system will most often break it. However, if you could figure out how to reconfigure just a handful of the most key interconnected components, then the upside is potentially large.
