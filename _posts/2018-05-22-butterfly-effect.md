We often quote the butterfly effect when some seemingly small, insignificant thing has an _unpredictable_, yet large effect on the outcome. A butterfly flapping its wings here and causing a typhoon half way around the world is the example often used. However, in Greg Egan's sci-fi novel [Permutation City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City), technology and science in the future are so advanced that people are able to use the butterfly effect to their advantage -- particularly, for weather control. By making minimal changes to a interdependent, seemingly chaotic system they could exact large beneficial outcomes disproportionate to their effort.
